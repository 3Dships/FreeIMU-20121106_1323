This is a slightly modified version of the FreeIMU code from http://www.varesano.net/projects/hardware/FreeIMU 

The mods are to FreeIMU_serial/FreeIMU_serial.ino, and add a default output of compass haeding, yaw,roll,and pitch in a useful format for FreeBoard. 

Use the Arduino IDE 1.02, and open the FreeIMU_serial project. Build and deploy to your ArduIMU v3. Then calibrate.

The ArduIMU will need calibration to provide stable output. Believe me there is no point in struggling on without doing the calibration (as per the FreeIMU site), you just get rubbish output and waste weeks (!*&%^$!).
